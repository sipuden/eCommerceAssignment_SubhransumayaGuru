eCommerce Assignment

This repository contains the solution to the eCommerce Transactions dataset assignment. Below is an explanation of the scripts included and instructions to run them.

Files Overview

1. FirstName_LastName_EDA.py

Description: This script performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the provided dataset. It analyzes customer data, product data, and transaction data to extract meaningful insights.

Key Steps:

Loads the datasets (Customers.csv, Products.csv, Transactions.csv).

Merges the datasets for comprehensive analysis.

Performs visualizations for trends in sales, region-wise performance, etc.

Derives actionable business insights.

2. FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.py

Description: This script builds a lookalike model that recommends three similar customers for a given customer based on their profiles and transaction history.

Key Steps:

Aggregates customer and transaction features (e.g., total purchase value, quantity).

Uses cosine similarity to find similar customers.

Outputs recommendations with similarity scores for the first 20 customers (CustomerID: C0001 - C0020) into FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.csv.

3. FirstName_LastName_Clustering.py

Description: This script performs customer segmentation using clustering techniques.

Key Steps:

Preprocesses customer data by scaling numerical features.

Applies K-Means clustering to group customers into segments.

Evaluates clustering performance using the Davies-Bouldin Index (DB Index).

Visualizes the clusters in a 2D space using PCA.

4. FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.csv

Description: Contains the lookalike recommendations for the first 20 customers.

Format: Each row includes a customer ID and a list of three similar customers with their similarity scores.

How to Run the Scripts

Prerequisites

Install Python 3.x.

Install required Python libraries:pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Ensure the dataset files (Customers.csv, Products.csv, Transactions.csv) are downloaded and placed in the same directory as the scripts.

Steps to Run

1. Run EDA Script:python FirstName_LastName_EDA.py

Outputs visualizations and insights in the terminal/graphs.

2. Run Lookalike Model:python FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.py

Generates the FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.csv file with the recommendations.

3. Run Clustering Script:python FirstName_LastName_Clustering.py


Displays cluster visualizations and outputs the DB Index value in the terminal.
